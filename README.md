# Project Mobius

## Description

This project, named "Mobius," is currently in its early stages with the earliest changes being made. As of now, the architecture is under consideration, and decisions are being finalized. The goal is to ship an initial version that meets the minimum requirements and can serve as a foundation for future development.

## Development Status

The project is actively evolving, and architectural decisions are subject to change based on ongoing discussions and considerations. While the current version may be considered as an "okay enough" release, future updates and improvements are planned to enhance functionality and overall design, as well as remaining true to the idea of adaptable agents operating upon a blockchain.
